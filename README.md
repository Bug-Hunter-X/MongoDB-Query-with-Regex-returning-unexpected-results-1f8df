This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using regular expressions within MongoDB queries. The `bug.js` file contains a query with a potentially incorrect regular expression, leading to unexpected or no results. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version of the query, addressing the identified problem.  The issue could arise from incorrect regular expression syntax, improper use of flags (e.g., `i` for case-insensitive matching), or a mismatch between the regex and the data in the collection. Understanding how to correctly construct and utilize regex within MongoDB queries is crucial for efficient database interactions.
